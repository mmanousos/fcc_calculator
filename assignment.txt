Build a JavaScript Calculator

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.


/*-- PSEUDOCODE --*/

required:
need a clear button
need buttons for all numbers 0-9
need equal button
need operator buttons + - / * 

nice to have:
maybe CE (clear entry) button
display area for current entry (digits or operator) / current value (after operator has been entered?)
e.g. 2 + 3 + would display 5 + ? 
or should it just show the chain of all entries 2 + 3 + ? 
answer (like example): double display -> tally for all entries running at bottom, latest integer entry in large display at top.

/*-- DESIGN THOUGHTS --*/

rounded corners for main body
rounded corners on button
different contrast colors for operator keys, equal key and clear key(s)
Maybe colors other than gray for body

/*-- SCRIPTING --*/

If a button with the number or operator class is clicked, the value of that button's text should be displayed in the 'display-under' field.

If a button with the number class is clicked, that button's value should be held in a variable. 

If a button with the number or operator class is clicked, that operation should track to a variable & the current total displayed in the 'display-main' field.

If the '=' button is clicked, the current total of the return variable should be displayed in the 'display-main' field. 

If the 'AC' button is clicked, the variable holding the calculating return value should be reset. 

If the 'C' button is clicked, only the last operation should be reversed from the return variable value.
