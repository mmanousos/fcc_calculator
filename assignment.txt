Build a JavaScript Calculator

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.


/*-- PSEUDOCODE --*/

required:
need a clear button
need buttons for all numbers 0-9
need equal button
need operator buttons + - / * 

nice to have:
maybe CE (clear entry) button
display area for current entry (digits or operator) / current value (after operator has been entered?)
e.g. 2 + 3 + would display 5 + ? 
or should it just show the chain of all entries 2 + 3 + ? 
answer (like example): double display -> tally for all entries running at bottom, latest integer entry in large display at top.

/*-- DESIGN THOUGHTS --*/

rounded corners for main body
rounded corners on button
different contrast colors for operator keys, equal key and clear key(s)
Maybe colors other than gray for body
